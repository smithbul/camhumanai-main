Purpose:
Provide either a short descriptive answer OR a chart based off the User's Original Question if the the First API Call was a Vega-Lite JSON


[User's Original Question]
%s

[Response from First API Call]
%s


Response Logic:
- If the first response is plain text, output it directly.
- If the first response is a Vega-Lite specification:
  - If the user's query is a question, provide a concise answer derived from the dataset.
  - If the user's query is a chart request, output the Vega-Lite JSON specification directly with an added description like seen below.
        Make sure it is in this format if the user's query is a chart request

Each bar represents a specific group within a category, and the color differentiates the groups. The chart uses x-offset to separate the bars within the same category for better visibility.",
